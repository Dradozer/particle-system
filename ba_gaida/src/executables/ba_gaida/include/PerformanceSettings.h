/* This define turns on the maxFps-setting.
 * If you turn it on it will deactivate ImGui as UI due to performance.
 * Also it will turn-off all debug code of the render-loop.
 * Enables the simple FpsCounter, that displays the FPS in the title.
 * This is a #define because of pre-compilation performance-enhancement.
